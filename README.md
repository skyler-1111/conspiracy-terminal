# ðŸ”º Conspiracy Terminal

This is a silly lil site I made cuz I was bored. So long story short this is a silly random conspiracy generator, which has some commands for you to run to generate one.
> half of the conspiracies generated are delulu and stupid, so dont't take this seriously lol.

## Commands
**help** â†’ type 'help' reveal the commands in the terminal

**generate** â†’ drops a fresh conspiracy theory | it has mode stupid turned on by default, unless you type "serious.//".

**serious.//** â†’ drops somewhat crazy but kinda makes sense theories | if you type this command once then generate, serious mode gets switched on. If you type .serious// again after the generated theory, it gets turned off. For eg:

**clear** â†’ wipes history faster than your search bar

**truth.exe** â†’ generates fresh ahh "what if" things

**reveal** â†’ reveals some stuffs at once

**ascend** â†’ does a lil animation (imma rate it 6.7/10)

## Why?
cuz we already got 6 million todo apps, letâ€™s make something unserious.  

## Example 
<img width="1144" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fab1b7f-ebff-4148-b661-ae3430f5a99c" />

## How to use
1. double click `conspiracy.html`  
2. touch grass (optional)
