# conspiracy-terminal
this is nothing other than a random, silly conspiracy generator terminal lol.

so basically there are some commands to use this which you can get by typing 'help' in the terminal, but I'm gonna write it here for reference :)
1. **generate**
   This command generates the theories. It only contains the non serious ones. for eg:
   <img width="571" height="75" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8a1e5f4-2ef0-4321-bb8c-fbe63a7558a5" />
2. **.serious//**
   Turn 'serious' mode on. Gives you less non-serious ones and with more vocabs (still silly and random af) . for eg:
   <img width="855" height="126" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70ea3bbc-561e-4a90-bb0b-ffd74f50702f" />
   note: dont forget to type the generate command too after .serious//. to turn it off, type .serious// again.
3. **clear**
    Clears the console.
4. **truth.exe**
   Generates some random ahh stuff.
   <img width="838" height="103" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad3e4741-826e-4e8b-b35d-41d39cbfa1b0" />
5. **reveal**
   Reveals a block of stuffs.
6. **help**
   Shows all the commands in the terminal.
